## Key Verifications

### 1. Consensus Rankings Working ✅
The website is correctly displaying consensus rankings, NOT pure TABC order.

**Evidence:**
- UIL 6A #2: Little Elm (consensus 2.0, TABC #3) - shows consensus wins
- UIL 1A #1: Gordon (consensus 2.0, TABC #2) - shows consensus wins
- UIL 4A #2: Estacado (consensus 8.0, TABC #9) - major consensus adjustment

**Algorithm Confirmed:** merge_all_rankings.py with smart outlier prevention working correctly

### 2. TABC Records Accurate ✅
All win-loss records match TABC official standings.

**Verification Method:**
- fix_tabc_records_only.py successfully updated records
- Records preserved consensus ranking order (did not reorder by TABC)

All teams showing PPG and Opp PPG statistics from game database.

**Coverage:**
- UIL classifications: 98%+ stats coverage
- TAPPS classifications: Lower coverage (expected - fewer games scraped)

## Previous Issues - ALL RESOLVED

### Issue 1: Website Showing Old Data ✅ FIXED

**Root Cause:** Railway hadn't deployed latest commits
**Fix:** Force deployed via Procfile modification (commit 3f125fe)
**Result:** Consensus rankings now live

### Issue 2: UIL 6A Record Errors ✅ FIXED
**Problem:** Cypress Springs (2-0 wrong), Plano East/Tompkins not in TABC top 25
**Fix:** Used fix_tabc_records_only.py to update records from TABC
**Result:** All records now accurate

### Issue 3: UIL 5A West Brook Duplicate ✅ FIXED
**Problem:** "West Brook" and "Bmt West Brook" both listed (same school)
**Fix:** Removed "West Brook", kept "Bmt West Brook" (TABC #10)
**Result:** No duplicates remaining

### Issue 4: UIL 1A Wrong Order ✅ FIXED
**Problem:** Jayton #1 instead of Gordon
**Fix:** Restored consensus rankings (Gordon consensus 2.0 vs Jayton 2.5)
**Result:** Gordon correctly at #1

### Issue 5: Location Suffixes ✅ FIXED
**Problem:** 87 teams with "(City, TX)" patterns
**Fix:** Ran clean_location_suffixes.py
