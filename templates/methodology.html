<h2>TBBAS Methodology</h2>

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>Texas Boys Basketball Analytics System (TBBAS) provides consensus rankings for Texas high school basketball teams across UIL, TAPPS, and SPC classifications.</p>

<h3>Ranking Sources</h3>
<p>TBBAS rankings are calculated using a weighted average of three trusted sources:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>TABC:</strong> Texas Association of Basketball Coaches weekly rankings</li>
    <li><strong>MaxPreps:</strong> Daily updated rankings from MaxPreps</li>
    <li><strong>GASO:</strong> Great American Shootout rankings</li>
</ul>

<p>By combining multiple ranking sources, TBBAS provides a more balanced consensus view than any single source alone.</p>

<h3>How Rankings Work</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Each team's position is determined by a weighted average of their rank in each available source</li>
    <li>UIL Classifications: Top 25 teams displayed</li>
    <li>TAPPS/SPC Classifications: Top 10 teams displayed</li>
    <li>Win-loss records are sourced from TABC (the official record keeper)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Update Schedule</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Weekly:</strong> Rankings updated every Monday combining all data sources</li>
    <li><strong>Season:</strong> November 11, 2025 - Last week of regular season</li>
</ul>
