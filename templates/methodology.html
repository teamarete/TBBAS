<h2>TBBAS Methodology</h2>

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>Texas Boys Basketball Analytics System (TBBAS) provides KenPom-style efficiency ratings for Texas high school basketball teams across UIL, TAPPS, and SPC classifications.</p>

<h3>Data Sources & Weighted Average System</h3>
<p>TBBAS rankings use a <strong>weighted average</strong> combining multiple data sources. The final top 25 (UIL) or top 10 (TAPPS) teams are determined by this consensus approach:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>25% Calculated Rankings:</strong> Efficiency ratings computed from game box scores</li>
    <li><strong>25% TABC:</strong> Texas Association of Basketball Coaches rankings (when available)</li>
    <li><strong>25% MaxPreps:</strong> Daily updated rankings from MaxPreps</li>
    <li><strong>25% GASO:</strong> Great American Shoot Out pre-season power rankings</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Important:</strong> TABC rankings serve as ONE of four data sources (25% weight), not a guarantee. A team ranked in TABC's top 25/10 may not appear in TBBAS top 25/10 if other sources rank them lower. Conversely, teams not ranked by TABC can still make TBBAS top 25/10 based on strong performance in other sources.</p>

<p><strong>How the weighted average works:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Each team receives a weighted average rank from all available sources</li>
    <li>Teams are sorted by this average, and the top 25 (UIL) or top 10 (TAPPS) receive sequential ranks 1-25 or 1-10</li>
    <li>When sources are unavailable, weights auto-adjust: 4 sources = 25% each, 3 sources = 33.3% each, 2 sources = 50% each</li>
    <li>If only TABC is available, it receives 100% weight as a fallback</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Coach Submissions:</strong> Box scores submitted directly by coaches via our online form contribute to the calculated efficiency ratings (25% weight in the overall system).</p>
<p style="background: #fff3cd; padding: 15px; border-radius: 5px; margin: 20px 0;">
    <strong>Note for Coaches:</strong> Your submitted box scores are automatically included in rankings calculations!
    The more detailed stats you provide (FG%, 3PT%, rebounds, etc.), the more accurate the efficiency ratings will be.
</p>

<h3>Core Metrics</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Net Rating:</strong> Offensive Efficiency - Defensive Efficiency (higher is better)</li>
    <li><strong>Offensive Efficiency:</strong> Points scored per 100 possessions</li>
    <li><strong>Defensive Efficiency:</strong> Points allowed per 100 possessions (lower is better)</li>
    <li><strong>Adjusted Tempo:</strong> Possessions per game (estimated from available stats)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Calculation Method</h3>
<p>Rankings are calculated using efficiency-based metrics similar to KenPom college basketball ratings:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Possessions are estimated using: <code>FGA + 0.44 × FTA + TO</code></li>
    <li>Offensive efficiency = (Points Scored / Possessions) × 100</li>
    <li>Defensive efficiency = (Points Allowed / Possessions) × 100</li>
    <li>Net Rating = Offensive Efficiency - Defensive Efficiency</li>
    <li>Teams are ranked by Net Rating within their classification</li>
</ol>

<h3>Update Schedule</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Daily:</strong> Box scores collected from MaxPreps and coach submissions</li>
    <li><strong>Weekly:</strong> Rankings recalculated every Monday combining all data sources</li>
    <li><strong>Season:</strong> November 11, 2025 - March 9, 2026</li>
</ul>
